########## DESCRIPTION  ##########
##################################

## Mortality test - v4.0

## Test a continuous measure of canopy position to infer competition
### Instead of using canopyStatus (TRUE/FALSE), I use here the canopyDistance which is the continuous difference between the tree height and s_star

# Using the [Generalized logistic Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_logistic_function) with positive growth rate only:

# - sim1: Upper = 1; Lower = 0; Beta = 0.5; Mid varying [-30 - 40]
# - sim2: Upper = 1; Lower varying [0 - 1]; Beta = 0.5; Mid varying [-30 - 40]
# - sim3: Upper = 1; Lower = varying [0 - 1]; Beta = varying [0.001 - 5]; Mid varying [-30 - 40]
