########## DESCRIPTION  ##########
##################################

## Growth test - v16.1 - multilevel r parameter at the plot level with plot basal area effect

# Using data start_size from V11.0 and plot random effect on the r parameter, let's make r also vary as a function of plot basal area

# Instead of using start_size of tree_id to have larger deltaTimes (better fit reason), use the last measured size t against t+1. DeltaTime will me more restricted to small values. In the other hand competition covariates will be closer in a temporal scale to the event to growth. So presumably this model should work better.

# This version runs the same model but for the RESEF database where individuals are measured from 1 cm dbh (instead of the 12.7 cm).
