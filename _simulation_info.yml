########## DESCRIPTION  ##########
##################################

## Growth test - v5.0

## Try two complementary function for the competition effect: Basal area for plot competition and canopyDistance for individual competition
## The idea is that even if you're in a dense plot, if you're big enough you won't be as much sensible than small individuals

# The last test (V4.0) showed a good potential for the interacting BA and canopyDistance for some species (sim1). Here I try to improve this formulation.
# While spliting the effect of BA and canopyDistance in the last test was fixed (0.5 * BA + 0.5 canopyDistance),
# here I try to make their split flexible. The canopyDistance won't affect the growth rate directly, but will just define when the BA will affect or not the growth rate.
# For example, a individual with high canopyDistance will have a competition effect of 1 (i.e. the plot BA does not matter)
# Equation: canopyDistanceEffect + [(1 - canopyDistanceEffect) * BAeffect]
# Where canopyDistance effect will follow the same flexible sigmoid function as used before.
# Basal area function is fixed to the half-normal distribution.

# - sim1: sigmoid function [upper = 1; lower = 0; beta = 0.20; Mid varying [-8, 15]]
# - sim2: sigmoid function [upper = 1; lower = 0; beta = varying [0.1- 0.9]; Mid varying [-8, 25]]
