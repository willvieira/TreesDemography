########## DESCRIPTION  ##########
##################################

## Growth test - v8.0

## With random effects at the plot level, compare two different function set for the canopyDistance predictor for competition:

# - sim1: sigmoid with `Lo` [0-1] and `beta` [0.1 - 0.5] parameters
# - sim2: sigmoid with `Lo` [0-1] and `mid` [-10 - 10] parameters
