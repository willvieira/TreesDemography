########## DESCRIPTION  ##########
##################################

## Growth test - v23.0 - r parameter with plot and individual random effects, and Basal area, temperature, and precipitation fixed effects
# Competition accounts for inter and intra BA_comp

# Using data start_size from V11.0 and plot random effect on the r parameter, let's make r also vary as a function of plot basal area

# Instead of using start_size of tree_id to have larger deltaTimes (better fit reason), use the last measured size t against t+1. DeltaTime will me more restricted to small values. In the other hand competition covariates will be closer in a temporal scale to the event to growth. So presumably this model should work better.

# version 18.0 makes r vary in function of annual mean temperature (bio_01_mean). The climate effect will follow a bell-shape function with an optimal climate and deviation parameters.

# version 19.0 adds the effect of total annual precipitation using the same function as used for mean annual temperature.

# Version 21.0 adds random effects at the individual level. Now the predictions will have another source of variation called `sigma_plotTree` that accounts for both plot and individual random effects. The total effect is split between them using the parameter `p_plotTree`, so `p_plotTree` is the variation derived from plot, while `1 - p_plotTree` the variation from individuals.

# Version 23.0 adds a theta parameter saying how much the inter specific competition matters. If close to 0, means only intra specific BA matters, the closer to 1 means both intra and inter have the same weight. Let's not constrant the upper boundery of the theta parameter in case inter is more important than intra competition.

# Version 23.1 uses scaled enviorment variables between 0 and 1.

# Final version, based in the v23.1 (but without individual random effects) will run the model for all observed points (merge train vs validation datasets)
# This version will also add more species to the simulation
