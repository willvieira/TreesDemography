########## DESCRIPTION  ##########
##################################

## Growth test - v18.0 - multilevel r parameter at the plot level with plot basal area effect

# Using data start_size from V11.0 and plot random effect on the r parameter, let's make r also vary as a function of plot basal area

# Instead of using start_size of tree_id to have larger deltaTimes (better fit reason), use the last measured size t against t+1. DeltaTime will me more restricted to small values. In the other hand competition covariates will be closer in a temporal scale to the event to growth. So presumably this model should work better.

# version 18.0 makes r vary in function of annual mean temperature (bio_01_mean). The climate effect will follow a bell-shape function with an optimal climate and deviation parameters.

# version 19.0 adds the effect of total annual precipitation using the same function as used for mean annual temperature.
