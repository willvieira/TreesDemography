########## DESCRIPTION  ##########
##################################

## Growth test - v1.0

## Basic growth rate as a function of canopyStatus (continuous canopy distance), envir and size
## Testing the effect of letting the optimal growth rate (pdg parameter) varying or not.

# - sim1: Open pdg [0 - ]
# - sim2: Closed pdg [0 - 30]
# - sim3: Fixed pdg for the 99% quantile (= 11.2 mm/year) found in the database (used quantile here to exclude extreme measure errors)
