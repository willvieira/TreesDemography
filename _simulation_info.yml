########## DESCRIPTION  ##########
##################################

## Growth test - v4.0

## Try two complementary function for the competition effect: Basal area for plot competition and canopyDistance for individual competition
## The idea is that even if you're in a dense plot, if you're big enough you won't be as much sensible than small individuals

# The difference between the two following simulations is that one will split the competition effect between BA and canopyDistance
# while the other will add a second competition effect (so we'll have five effects on baseline growth instead of four)

# - sim1: split competition effect between BA and canopyDistance [pdg * (0.5 * BA + 0.5 * canopyDistance)]
# - sim2: Aditional competition effect with canopyDistance [pdg * BA * canopyDistance]
