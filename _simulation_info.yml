########## DESCRIPTION  ##########
##################################

## Mortality test - v3.1

## Test the effect of growth rate instead of size as predictor of mortality rate.
## Growth rate effect following the Generalized logistic function

# sim1: gls with Lo and Mid parameters (the same as v3.0 but with psi and beta with more strict distribution)
# sim2: gls with Lo fixed at 0 and Mid parameters larger than sim1
# sim3: gls with Lo fixed at 0, Mid varying larger than sim1, and growth rate (gamma) varying
