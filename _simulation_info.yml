########## DESCRIPTION  ##########
##################################

## Mortality test - v5.0

## Test the use of plot basal area instead of canopy derived from PPA
# Trying 3 (sim) distinct functions to model survival as a function of basal area:
# First and second using the Generalized logistic Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_logistic_function) with negative growth rate
# And third a lognormal distribution with flexible optimal survival close to low basal area

# - sim1: Upper = 1; Lower = varying [0 - 1]; Beta = -0.5; Mid varying [0 - 360]
# - sim2: Upper = varying [0 - 1]; Lower = 0; Beta = -0.5; Mid varying [0 - 360]
# - sim3: lognorm distribution with optimal [0 - 200] and variance [0 - 5]
