########## DESCRIPTION  ##########
##################################

## Recruitmenet test - v1.0

## Compare base model with extended model allwoing fast transition to second age stage

## - sim1: simplest model, no fast transition allowed (individuals must start on first age stage)
## - sim2: allow random individuals who are able to grow fast enough to enter the second age stage
