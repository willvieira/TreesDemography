########## DESCRIPTION  ##########
##################################

## Mortality test - v3.0

## Test the effect of growth rate instead of size as predictor of mortality rate.
## Growth rate effect will be tested using two different functions:

# sim1: functional reponse type II (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_response)
# sim2: Generalized logistic function (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_logistic_function)
