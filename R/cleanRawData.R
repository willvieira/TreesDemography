##############################


##############################
# Steps:
  # Load data
  # Calculate basal area (plot and species level)
  # Remove some problematic species
  # Remove individuals with climate NA
  # Remove character `-` in species_id's
  # Separete between Growth, mortality and fecundity data

    # For growth
      # Rewrite data table in a transition way
      # Keep species with more than 1e4 individuals
      # Calculate canopyStatus and canopyDistance

    # For mortality
      # Keep the same species as in the growth filter above
      # Remove trees already died in first measurement
      # Keep only the first death record
      # Fix height problem
      # Rewrite data table in a transition way
      # Remove negative growth
      # Remove extreme deltaYear (2 < deltaYear < 15)
      # Check if above cleaning worked
      # Calculate canopyStatus and canopyDistance

    # For fecundity
      # Keep the same species as in the growth filter above

  # Filter species_id to keep species with at least 2e4 measurements
  # save growth, mortality and fecundity databases

 # TODO
 # - nbMeasure == 1 for regeneration is really not appropriated. Think in a new column to assign the first measure of an individual
  # - By tree_id, quantify the number of measuremnts times. Like three times, 1, 2 and 3 for each measurement
 # - Figure out if it's a good idea to remove NA of BA now
 # - I believe it it's a good idea to put here the part of the code preparing for the random forest
 # - organize everything in a transition way, so I can add a delayed measure of BA and BA_sp
 # - Think about the Dom's problem. Negative correlation between competition and seed source
 # - Separete random forest by shade torance. I believe it won't be the same predictors driving regeneration
