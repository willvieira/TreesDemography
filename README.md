# Trees demography

## Bayesian models to predict trees vital rates

The growth, mortality, and recruitment vital rates are organized into their specific branch (*e.g.* [`test_growth`](https://github.com/willvieira/TreesDemography/tree/test_growth)).
These branches save a series of tests concerning model definition, convergence, data structure, etc.

For each test, I create a new branch (*e.g.* `testGrowth1.0`), and once the test is complete, I merge it into its main test branch (`test_growth`).
The diagnostics of each test are saved on the `gh-pages` branch, and can be seen [here](https://willvieira.github.io/TreesDemography/).
